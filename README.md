# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

To analyze Green Energy Stock data by using VBA.

### Purpose

We helped Steve to first analyze the Daqo’s stock by calculating the yearly return to make sure his parents were making a valuable investment. 

Then we helped Steve to choose a better stock by analyzing all the stocks. It’s important to find out how actively each stock was traded. Next, we would compare them by finding out how was the return for each stock for both 2017 and 2018.

In this project, we will edit, or refactor the solution code to loop through all the data that we did in this module. Then, we will determine any advantages or disadvantages of using VBA and refactoring code.

## Results

### DQ

The data shows that although Daqo’s stock has the highest return percentage in 2017, it dropped over 63% in 2018. Thus, Daqo’s stock is not recommended for Steve’s parents to invest.

### All Stocks

Additionally, most stocks performed well in 2017 and dropped in 2018. According to the return in 2018, there are two potential stocks: ENPH and RUN. Both stocks have relatively high return rates and worth to invest. 

## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring Codes

Refactoring code is more common and efficient with fewer steps. It’s easier to read, which is helpful if you want to look back at the codes in the future. It takes a lot lesser time to run, which takes lesser memory.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Codes

Refactoring codes can be time-consuming. Mistakes or missing steps may happen if you are not focused and paid attention. Then the results may be affected.
